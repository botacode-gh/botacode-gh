I recently (May 2023) completed a 3-month Web Development course at [neue fische](https://github.com/neuefische), in which I had tons of fun building these:

- [bota-crossing](https://bota-crossing.vercel.app/): Companion app for _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_. Add items you've found in game to your digital island and manage them!
- [Tourio](https://botacode-tourio-app.vercel.app/): Add your favorite sightseeing locations and some info on them.
