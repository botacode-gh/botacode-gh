# 👋 Hi, I'm Xaver!

Web Developer

I recently (May 2023) completed a 3-month Web Development course at [neue fische](https://github.com/neuefische), in which I had tons of fun building these (and more!):

- 🏝️ [bota-crossing](https://bota-crossing.vercel.app/) ([repo](https://github.com/botacode-gh/bota-crossing/#readme)): Companion app for _[Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons)_. Add items you've found in game to your digital island and manage them! 
- 🗺️ [Tourio](https://botacode-tourio-app.vercel.app/) ([repo](https://github.com/botacode-gh/tourio-app#readme)): Add your favorite sightseeing locations and some info on them.
